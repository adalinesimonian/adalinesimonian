I'm Adaline (it/they/she), but you can call me Addie! I've been working on software for years in different places using different tools and languages. I've last worked as a Lead Software Engineer and Engineering Manager at [ServiceTitan](https://servicetitan.com/), but where my software passion came to life and has been since is in the [open source](https://opensource.org/faq#category-basics) community.

Nowadays, I maintain:

- 🤵🏼 The official [Stylelint extension](https://github.com/stylelint/vscode-stylelint) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- 🏃🏼 [jest-runner-vscode](https://github.com/adalinesimonian/jest-runner-vscode), a Jest runner for running extension tests in VS Code (used for Stylelint!)
- 🔐 [node-adauth](https://github.com/adalinesimonian/node-adauth), a Node.js package for authenticating with Active Directory
- 🖥️ [jshiki](https://github.com/adalinesimonian/jshiki), a Node.js package for evaluating JavaScript expressions

## You can make open source happen, too!

I'm just somebody online — if I can do it, so can you! Get involved in the open source community and help keep the software, tools, and ecosystems you love and depend on running. Open source would never work without the people who volunteer their time and effort!

- **Something's not working?** Got some spare time? Take a stab at fixing it!
- **Think a tool could use a feature that you'd like to see?** Try and see if you can figure out how to make it happen!
- **Want to help make a new project a reality?** Put something together and share it with the community!

Don't worry about getting things wrong! Everyone, from people just starting out writing their first small program to well-established engineers with years of experience, gets stuff wrong all the time. I do, too — plenty of times! Trying and getting something wrong is the best way to learn and is always better than not trying at all.

And even if you don't have the time to contribute code, you can still help the community by contributing to documentation, testing, and other resources. Even a well-written, easy-to-understand bug report makes a difference.

So have at it! **You can do it!**
