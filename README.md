I'm Adaline (they/she), but you can call me Addie! I've been working on software for years in different places using different tools and languages. My passion for software grew out of my involvement in the [open source](https://opensource.org/faq#basics-of-open-source) community.

Some of the projects I maintain are:

- üìñ [Ordbok API](https://ordbokapi.org), a public and open-source GraphQL API for data from [the official Norwegian language dictionaries](https://ordbokene.no)
- üéÆ [gdvm](https://gdvm.io), a command-line version manager for Godot built in Rust
- üá≥üá¥ [Norsk-bott](https://github.com/NLLCommunity/discord-norsk-bott), a Discord bot for the [Norwegian Language Learning](https://discord.gg/norwegian) server
- ü§µüèº The official [Stylelint extension](https://github.com/stylelint/vscode-stylelint) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## You can make open source happen, too.

I'm just somebody online ‚Äî if I can do it, so can you. Get involved in the open source community and help keep the software, tools, and ecosystems you love and depend on running. The open source community cannot function without people who volunteer their time and effort.

- **Something's not working?** Got some spare time? Take a stab at fixing it.
- **Think a tool could use a feature that you'd like to see?** Try and see if you can figure out how to make it happen.
- **Want to help make a new project a reality?** Put something together and share it with the community.

Don't worry about getting things wrong. Everyone, from people just starting out writing their first small program to well-established engineers with years of experience, gets stuff wrong all the time. **I make mistakes every day** ‚Äî you could even say my job is making mistakes. Trying and getting something wrong is the best way to learn and is always better than not trying at all. If you are not making mistakes, you are not learning or growing.

If you don't have the time to contribute code, you can still help the community by contributing to documentation, testing, and other resources. Even a well-written, easy-to-understand bug report makes a difference.
